            This ResearchHub User Agreement (the "<strong>Terms</strong>")
            applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps,
            widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "

            <strong>ResearchHub</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," or "
            <strong>us</strong>"). By participating in the ResearchHub Services
            (for example through posting content, reviewing or commenting on
            content, or acting as a moderator) you will have the opportunity to
            earn native ResearchCoin tokens (“[<strong>ResearchCoins]</strong>
            ”), as more fully described below and on the Services. The
            ResearchHub website includes additional policies and requirements
            regarding each of the foregoing, including processes and technical
            requirements for participating in the Services, policies regarding
            how to earn ResearchCoins, our Content Policy (as further defined
            below), and related policies (the “

            are incorporated into and made part of these Terms.{" "}

            By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these
            Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use

            of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you
            represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that
            company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you”
            and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.

            <strong>1. Access to the Services</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            1.1 Eligibility. You may access and use the Services only if you are
            a legal entity or individual 18 years or older and capable of
            forming a binding contract and are not barred from participating
            under applicable law. You may not establish an account or

            region that is subject to a general trade embargo administered by
            the United States Office of Foreign Asset Controls, including Iran,

            over the age required by the laws of your country to create an
            account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received
            verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian. You cannot
            use the Services if you are not able to form legally binding
            contracts (for example, if you are under 18 years old); if you are
            temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using ResearchHub's

            economic or trade sanctions.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.2 Registration and Accounts. In order to access and use certain of
            the Services, you will have to register and create an account (your
            “<strong>Account</strong>”). Upon registration you will receive a
            user identification, keys, and/or other credentials that will be
            used to associate you to the Services (collectively, “
            <strong>Credentials</strong>”). You are solely responsible for the
            security of your Credentials, are required to take appropriate
            measures to safeguard your Credentials, and will be responsible for
            any unauthorized access to or use of your Credentials. You will be
            solely responsible for all acts or omissions of any person using the
            Services or your Account with your Credentials. All transactions
            generated by use of your Credentials or originating from your
            Account will be deemed to be authorized by you. You will promptly
            notify ResearchHub if you discover or suspect that someone has
            accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you
            use a strong password that is used only with the Services. You will
            not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior
            written approval.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.3 Accuracy of Account Information. You represent and warrant that
            the information you provide for your account is accurate, complete,
            and up-to-date. You agree to update such information to keep it
            accurate and complete throughout your access to and use of the
            Services. Failure to provide or keep your information accurate,
            complete, and up-to-date may result in suspension or termination of
            your Account.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. The Services</strong>
          </p>
          <p>2.1 ResearchCoins</p>
          <p>
            ResearchCoins are a virtual item controlled by you and maintained on
            the Ethereum blockchain. ResearchCoin totals and transactions are
            stored as standard ERC-20 tokens publicly and permanently on the
            Ethereum blockchain. ResearchCoins are distributed on a monthly
            basis and are linked publicly to your username. The community can
            modify the distribution of ResearchCoins from the default
            distribution before the ResearchCoins are written into the Ethereum
            blockchain. You have six months after distribution to claim your
            ResearchCoins before the claim expires.
          </p>
          <p>
            ResearchCoins have no monetary value (i.e., are not a cash account
            or equivalent), cannot be sold to other users, and cannot be
            exchanged for cash or for any other goods and services outside of
            ResearchHub’s virtual goods or services. ResearchHub does not
            guarantee that ResearchCoins, or any virtual goods or services that
            ResearchCoins provide access to or use of (e.g., Promotion, and
            Grants), will continually be offered or will be available for any
            particular length of time, or that they will have or retain any
            value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Services will allocate ResearchCoin to your account based in
            part on a reputation score determined in accordance with the
            algorithm described in the ResearchHub Program Requirements. Your
            reputation score will be based upon a number of factors, as
            described in the ResearchHub Program Requirements. We reserve the
            right to change the algorithm for calculating reputation scores at
            any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY ResearchCoin
            REWARDS FROM RESEARCH HUB OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR
            PARTRICIPARTION IN OR USE OF THE SERVICES. RESEARCHHUB DOES NOT
            GUARANTEE ANY ResearchCoin REWARDS WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE
            AMOUNT OF TIME OR EFFORT INVOLVED IN YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE
            SERVICES OR THE VALUE OF YOUR CONTENT. PARTICIPATION IN THE
            RESEARCHUB SERVICES AND POSTING YOUR CONTENT IS DONE AT YOUR SOLE
            DISCRETION.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>2.2 Transactions</p>
          <p>
            You control your ResearchCoins and you can transfer them to other
            ResearchHub accounts or any Ethereum blockchain address. We have no
            control over the Ethereum blockchain and cannot ensure any
            transaction details you submit via the Services will be completed.
            Once transaction details have been submitted to the Ethereum
            blockchain via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel,
            reverse, or otherwise modify your transaction details. We strongly
            encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before
            submitting them.
          </p>
          <p>2.3 Fees</p>
          <p>
            We do not currently charge fees for ResearchCoin transactions, but
            we reserve the right to do so in the future. Other Ethereum wallets
            may charge for Ethereum network costs associated with ResearchCoins
            transactions.

          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services
            (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you.
            Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of
            the Services will be subject to these Terms, as they may be updated
            from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to
            any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation
            of the Services or any part thereof.
          </p>

            <strong>4. Your Content</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos,

            Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through

            warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to
            grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms.
            Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose
            yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all
            necessary rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you

            This license allows anyone to reuse the content for any purpose, as
            long as attribution is provided. We consider a hyperlink or URL back
            to the source page on the ResearchHub Services sufficient
            attribution. You agree to include in Your Content an express notice
            that Your Content is licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the rights granted under the CC BY 4.0 license, you
            grant to ResearchHub the following license with respect to Your
            Content:

            provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and

            right for us to make Your Content available for syndication,
            broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies,
            organizations, or individuals who partner with ResearchHub. You also
            agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and
            you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or
            attribution with respect to Your Content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about ResearchHub or our

            Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of
            these Terms, a violation of the Policy posted on our website, as may

            under our control, and we are not responsible for any such
            Third-Party Content. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own
            risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before
            proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party

          <p>
            If you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, including
            a contest or sweepstakes, you alone are responsible for conducting
            the promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and
            regulations. The terms of your promotion must specifically state
            that the promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated
            with ResearchHub and the rules for your promotion must require each
            entrant or participant to release ResearchHub from any liability
            related to the promotion.

            <strong>7. Moderators</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Moderating a Hub is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be
            available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for
            actions taken by the moderators. We recognize that moderation can
            take some work, so we may change the features or abilities
            associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice.
            We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to moderate
            at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach
            of these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>If you choose to moderate a Hub:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You agree that when you receive reports related to your community,
              that you will take action to moderate by removing content and/or
              escalating to the admins for review;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You may not represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of
              ResearchHub, Inc.;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf
              of ResearchHub, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our
              written approval;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of
              compensation or favor from third parties;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you have access to non-public information as a result of
              moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in
              connection with your performance as a moderator; and
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            ResearchHub reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn
            any action or decision of a moderator if ResearchHub believes that
            such action or decision is not in the interest of ResearchHub or the
            ResearchHub community.

            We want you to enjoy ResearchHub, so if you have an issue or
            dispute, you agree to raise it and try to resolve it with us
            informally. You can contact us with feedback and concerns here or by

          <p>
            Except for the government entities listed below: any claims arising
            out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be governed
            by the laws of California, other than its conflict of laws rules.
            Except as set forth below with respect to arbitration, all disputes
            related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the
            federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California; and
            you consent to personal jurisdiction in these courts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any
            dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these
            Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
            validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content
            (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be resolved solely
            by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class,
            representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and we
            agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
            interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and we
            are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a
            class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination
            of these Terms.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) Exceptions and Opt-out. As limited exceptions to the above: (i)
            you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it
            qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or
            other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the
            infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property
            rights. In addition, you will retain the right to opt out of
            arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute if you provide us with
            written notice of your desire to do so by email at{" "}
            <a href="mailto:hi@videocoin.io" target="_blank">
              hi@videocoin.io
            </a>{" "}
            or by regular mail at [postal address] within thirty (30) days
            following the date you first agree to these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            (c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration
            will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“
            <strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the
            “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The
            AAA Rules are available at{" "}
            <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">
              www.adr.org
            </a>{" "}
            or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start
            arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and
            give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The
            AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at{" "}
            <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">
              www.adr.org
            </a>
            .{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, you may choose whether
            the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
            submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or
            video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established
            by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a
            hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration
            hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live,
            unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that
            the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues
            relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and
            scope of this arbitration agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            (d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and
            arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. We’ll pay for all
            filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your
            Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your
            Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our
            attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you.
            If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of
            attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable
            law.
          </p>
          <p>
            (e) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
            AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
            AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is
            resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
            another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise
            preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If
            this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the
            entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
          </p>
          <p>
            (f) Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions
            of Section 14 (Changes to Terms), if we change any of the terms of
            this Section 13 (Dispute Resolution) after the date you first
            accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
            Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice
            (including by email to{" "}
            <a href="mailto:disputes@videocoin.io" target="_blank">
              disputes@videocoin.io
            </a>
            ) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as
            indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of our
            email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change,
            you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and
            us in accordance with the terms of this Section 13 (Dispute
            Resolution) as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or
            accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
          </p>
          <p>
            (g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in
            sub-section (e) (Class Action Waiver), if an arbitrator or court of
            competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is
            invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still
            apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Government Entities</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a U.S. city, county, or state government entity, then
            this Section 13 does not apply to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a U.S. federal government entity: any claims arising out
            of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be governed by
            the laws of the United States of America without reference to
            conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws
            of California (other than its conflict of law rules) will apply in
            the absence of applicable federal law. All disputes related to these
            Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state
            courts located in San Francisco, California.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>13. Changes to these Terms</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make
            changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Services and update
            the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion,
            are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the
            address associated with your Account (if you have chosen to provide
            an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our
            Services. By continuing to access or use the Services on or after
            the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by
            the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you
            must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become
            effective.

            <strong>14. Additional Terms</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to
            additional terms before using a specific product or service offered
            by ResearchHub (“<strong>Additional Terms</strong>”). To the extent
            any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms
            govern with respect to your use of the corresponding Service.
