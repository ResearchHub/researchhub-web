          <p className={css(styles.paragraph)}>2.1 ResearchCoins</p>
          <p>
            ResearchCoins are a virtual item controlled by you and maintained on
            the Ethereum blockchain. ResearchCoin totals and transactions are
            stored as standard ERC-20 tokens publicly and permanently on the
            Ethereum blockchain. ResearchCoins are distributed on a monthly
            basis and are linked publicly to your username. The community can
            modify the distribution of ResearchCoins from the default
            distribution before the ResearchCoins are written into the Ethereum
            blockchain. You have six months after distribution to claim your
            ResearchCoins before the claim expires.
          </p>
          <p className={css(styles.paragraph)}>
            ResearchCoins have no monetary value (i.e., are not a cash account
            or equivalent), cannot be sold to other users, and cannot be
            exchanged for cash or for any other goods and services outside of
            ResearchHub’s virtual goods or services. ResearchHub does not
            guarantee that ResearchCoins, or any virtual goods or services that
            ResearchCoins provide access to or use of (e.g., Promotion, and
            Grants), will continually be offered or will be available for any
            particular length of time, or that they will have or retain any
            value.
          </p>
          <p className={css(styles.paragraph)}>
            The Services will allocate ResearchCoin to your account based in
            part on a reputation score determined in accordance with the
            algorithm described in the ResearchHub Program Requirements. Your
            reputation score will be based upon a number of factors, as
            described in the ResearchHub Program Requirements. We reserve the
            right to change the algorithm for calculating reputation scores at
            any time.

            ResearchHub accounts or any Ethereum blockchain address. We have no
            control over the Ethereum blockchain and cannot ensure any
            transaction details you submit via the Services will be completed.

            encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before
            submitting them.

          <p className={css(styles.paragraph)}>2.3 Fees</p>

            We do not currently charge fees for ResearchCoin transactions, but
            we reserve the right to do so in the future. Other Ethereum wallets

            We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make
            changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Services and update
            the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our sole discretion,
            are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the
            address associated with your Account (if you have chosen to provide
            an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our
            Services. By continuing to access or use the Services on or after
            the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by
            the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you
            must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become
            effective.

            You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by
            deleting your Account and discontinuing your use of all Services. If
            you stop using the Services without deactivating your Accounts, your
            Accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.

            These Terms, together with any Additional Terms, our Privacy Policy,
            and our Content Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you

            to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision
            of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be illegal, invalid or
            unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in effect. You may
